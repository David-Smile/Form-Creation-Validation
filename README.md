# Form Creation and Validation

A simple and robust form validation system built with vanilla JavaScript. This project demonstrates client-side form validation using basic JavaScript string methods and DOM manipulation.

## Features

- Real-time form validation
- Input validation for:
  - Username (minimum 3 characters)
  - Email (must contain '@' and '.')
  - Password (minimum 8 characters)
- Clear error messaging
- Success/error feedback display
- Responsive design

## Project Structure

```

├── index.html          # Main HTML file with form structure
├── style.css          # CSS styles for the form and feedback
├── script.js          # JavaScript validation logic
└── README.md          # Project documentation

## Implementation Details

### Form Validation Rules

1. **Username**
   - Must be at least 3 characters long
   - Whitespace is trimmed from both ends

2. **Email**

   - Must contain '.' symbol
   - Basic email format validation

3. **Password**
   - Must be at least 8 characters long
   - Whitespace is trimmed from both ends

### Error Handling

- Form submission is prevented if validation fails
- Clear error messages are displayed for each validation failure
- Success message is shown when all validations pass
- Console error logging for debugging purposes

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Fill out the form and submit
4. View validation feedback
